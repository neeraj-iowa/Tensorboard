after installing and running anaconda open "Anaconda Navigator"
click Environmant in extreme left and then on down click the + box, in the pop up small window write "what ever name you like to give to this environmanr, for ex:"tensorflow or tiger or lion what ever"
select python 3.6 frrom packages drop down box,then click create
now from the rightside select all from first drop down box, and write tensorflow in search box and click enter, select tensorflow(not tensorflow gpu or r-tensorflow)

For Tensorflow go to your windows button click Anaconda3 and from there click Anaconda prompt,
in Anaconda prompt write activate tensorflow       and click enter.
your promt will change to "(tensorflow) C:\Users\xyz\pp>"
now write pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow    (((( just for case to get the latest verstion))))
in your jupyter notebook write a small programme 
import tensorflow as tf  (shift enter)
a=tf.constant(5)
b=tf.constant(6)
c=a*b                    (shift enter)
sess=tf.Session()        (shift enter)
File_Writer=tf.summary.FileWriter('C:\\Users\\Neeraj\\AnacondaProjects\\tf\\graph' , sess.graph)     (shift enter)** here my directory was C:\\Users\\Neeraj\\AnacondaProjects\\tf\\graph  please you can write your directory name, it's simple.
now write tensorboard --logdir=C:\Users\XXX\AnacondaProjects\YY\ZZ    (( you  need to  write your directory name here))
press enter and then when the system executes this code open http://grey:6006/#graphs in your browser and tensorboard is working.
